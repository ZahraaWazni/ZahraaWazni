## Who am I ? :book:
My name is Zahraa and I am passionate about programming :computer: ! I like creating programs and learning new languages 🥰. 

🌱 I’m currently studing computer science and mathematics at the university of strasbourg. I am also doing a bachelor in computer science online at University of the People. 


## Programming skills ⌨️ 🖱️
I already used different languages to write some of my programs but still I have a lot to learn and to explore 🔭. 
I have worked on programming simple games such as hangman, sokoban and a quiz game using Python, C and java. I also wrote some basic programs using the previous languages to create simple functions. 
I am still learning and improving in the programming field.

Here are some languages that i drew for fun :
